            <p id="pAbout">Let's start from the beginning... My name is Caitlin Ashtari. I'm from a small town called San Juan Bautista, California, (population: 1,600). I grew up there with my educator parents, and two older brothers, until I headed off to study biological sciences at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. In my fourth year of college, I changed my major to Creative Writing.</p>

            <p>After five long years of college, I moved to San Francisco and landed a job as a Customer Operations Expert at TRX Training, a global fitness company. I quickly found out that I wanted a job where I could help people, instead of help a company make a profit, so I went into the family business of teaching! I enrolled at Dominican University of California and got my teaching credential and landed a job as a kindergarten teacher at a Title I elementary school in San Rafael, California. </p>

            <p>While living in San Rafael, I met my amazing, handsome, intelligent, funny husband, Omid. We adopted a puppy together, decided to move to Portland together, got married together, and went on many adventures together. Now, Omid works at a local tech start-up, and I am re-evaluating my career while substitute teaching and teaching teachers Guided Language Acquisition Design (BE GLAD) on the side.</p>

            <p>Listening to Treehouse videos over Omid's shoulder sparked my interest in coding. I hopped on Treehouse myself and was hooked. I could spend hours and hours watching videos on Treehouse and completing challenges on FreeCodeCamp. A friend of ours, a recent Epicodus graduate, introduced us to the school. Omid and I jumped on board, and now here we are! Eventually, I would like to be able to build an application or program that could improve the education system in some way, from the outside-in, (I've found the opposite is nothing short of impossible).</p>

            <p>My current hobbies mostly involve coding, but I also like to run and ride my bike with our dog, read, rock climb, hike, garden, and read some more.</p>
